# Maintainers Code Of Conduct

To foster a positive and collaborative community, we have established the following guidelines that all maintainers must adhere to. These rules define what maintainers are expected to do and refrain from doing to ensure the integrity and quality of the project.  

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).  

## Maintainers' Responsibilities
The maintainers:

- **MUST** follow project technical guidelines, and maintainer requirement.
- **MUST** maintain a respectful and positive attitude within the community, refraining from engaging in arguments or insults.
- **MUST** allow core team members to inspect and review the source code they are working with.
- **MUST NOT** add or remove packages without a valid and justifiable reason.
- **MUST NOT** modify the core Halcyon source code without prior approval.
- **MUST NOT** include any modifications such as Audio Mods (e.g., Dolby, Dirac, ViperFX4Android) or third-party cameras (e.g., GCam) unless they are ported from the stock ROM of the device being maintained.
- **MUST** provide regular updates to the project, with a minimum frequency of one update per month.
- **MUST** actively participate in discussions regarding the project, especially when decisions affect the devices they maintain.

- **MUST NOT** engage in any form of plagiarism or misrepresentation of work. All work must be original or properly attributed.
- **MUST** respect deadlines for major updates or releases, and notify the team promptly if they are unable to meet those deadlines.
- **MUST** ensure that all build files, device-specific configurations, and scripts are kept up to date with upstream changes.
- **MUST NOT** use official maintainer privileges for personal gain, such as advertising personal modifications as official Halcyon releases.
- **SHOULD** maintain clear communication with the team and the community about progress, roadblocks, or changes in their capacity to maintain a device.
